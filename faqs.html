                    We’re committed to showcasing web3 and demonstrating how truly wonderful

                <p>
                    The Content Economy Protocol is the first decentralized protocol 
                    that enables the discovery, evaluation, licensing, and exchange of 
                    non-physical content. It is designed specifically for digital-content 
                    tokenization (automated royalties, fan gifting), governance (via micro-DAOs), 
                    and liquidity (via DeFi instruments i.e., subscription payments and lending).

                <p>
                    To facilitate and harness a tokenized ecosystem that unlocks creator value
                    - centralises fans and decentralises revenue while monetising content with 
                    built-in tokenized incentives. $LNQ is a multi-chain native cryptocurrency 
                    in the LNQ network that serves as the main governance token and reward for fans, 
                    subscription payments, lending and other DeFi applications, which are managed and 
                    branded as project-owned products.

                    Upon completion of the Public Sale, we expect and significant uptick in price as we begin to fulfil 
                    our liquidity pipeline: Waiting list of creators and fans transacting on the Lynqyo ecosystem. <br><br>
                    The strategic goal: We’re building Lynqyo to be the universal token of choice for decentralised marketplaces. 
                    We believe the first step towards that goal is to build a solid foundation of shipping an easy-to-use, 
                    content-first ecosystem. <br><br>
                    Underpinned by the Lynqyo Content Economy protocol the foundational objective is to become token of 
                    choice for web3 projects that aim to deploy marketplaces but lack the infrastructure, Protocol, 
                    linked-blockchain, back-end ecosystem and front-end transactional marketplace. <br><br>
                    This coupled with the demand and education around decentralised web3 marketplaces and ‘community flight’ 
                    from conventional centralised platforms gives confidence that those that support and invest in the primacy 
                    of Lynqyo are yielding not only short but long-term returns.

                    $LNQ token will be in both the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and the Ethereum (ETH). Once the Public Sale is complete,
                    a bridge will be deployed to connect the two chains.
